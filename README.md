## Transformer Encoder Architecture

This notebook focuses on the Transformer Encoder, a key component of the full Transformer model introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017). Key components implemented and explained include:

1. Positional Encoding
2. Multi-Head Attention
   - Scaled Dot-Product Attention
   - Parallel attention heads
3. Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
4. Layer Normalization
5. Residual Connections

The architecture is implemented from scratch using PyTorch, providing insights into each component's role and functionality.

## Implementation Highlights

- Detailed mathematical explanations for each component
- Step-by-step code breakdown
- Visualization of attention weights
- Analysis of the model's internal representations

## Application: Heated Speech Detection

To demonstrate the Transformer Encoder's capabilities, we apply it to the task of detecting heated speech in Twitter data. This includes:

- Data preprocessing for Twitter text
- Adaptation of the Transformer Encoder for text classification
- Training and evaluation procedures

The notebook is designed to be run cell-by-cell, allowing for a deep dive into the Transformer Encoder architecture and its application.

## Future Work

- Extend to full Transformer (Encoder-Decoder) implementation
- Experiment with variations like
